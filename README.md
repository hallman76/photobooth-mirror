Strangely enough, PhotoBooth doesn't come with a "mirror" effect built-in. You can, however, create plugins pretty easily using Quartz Composer, a visual editor that ships with XCode. Creating a mirror plugin is as easy as it gets. 

download *Mirror.qtz* into <your user folder>/Library/Compositions
